Beginner’s Guide to Getting Started with GitHub Actions
Overview of GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool provided by GitHub, designed to streamline tasks within software development workflows. It allows developers to create custom workflows that can be triggered by specific events, such as pushes to a repository, pull requests, or scheduled times. This tool is commonly used for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), testing, and other automation tasks, making it invaluable in a developer's toolkit.

What You’ll Learn in This Guide

This beginner guide is based on an introductory video about GitHub Actions, covering:

GitHub Actions Basics - Understanding GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment - Key terms and their role in automating project workflows.
Custom Workflows - Creating workflows that can be automated and tailored to different project needs.
Key Terms - Important terminology like "GitHub," "code repository," and "Git" will be explained to eliminate confusion.
Why GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions can automate entire development workflows, making it easier to manage projects in various fields, including data science, web development, and machine learning. The custom workflows you’ll learn to create will enable automated responses to events in the repository, such as code pushes, pull requests, or regular time-based triggers.

Key Concepts in GitHub Actions
GitHub - Acts as a central code repository where code is committed, branches are created, and collaborative work is managed. While GitHub is one popular option, other repositories like GitLab are also widely used.
Git - A distributed Version Control System (VCS) that enables developers to track changes in code. It allows collaborative development by managing different versions of the code, helping teams work efficiently on the same project.

Collaborative Development and GitHub Actions in CI/CD
Working Collaboratively on Projects

In a project, especially in fields like data science, multiple developers often work together on different parts or “stories” of the project. For example:

Developer A works on Story A (a specific module),
Developer B on Story B, and
Developer C on Story C.
Each developer contributes their work to a central codebase that needs to be continuously tracked, managed, and eventually merged into the main project. Tracking code changes is essential because each developer’s files and updates need to be managed to avoid issues when integrating everything into the project.

Git and GitHub’s Role in Collaboration

Git is used to track changes in code. It helps developers manage multiple versions of files and handle conflicts (e.g., if two developers work on the same file, like app.py, conflicts may arise, which Git helps resolve).
GitHub is a central code repository where all project code is stored and managed collaboratively. Developers commit their changes from their local environments to the GitHub repository.
By using Git, developers can create branches for separate tasks, switch between them, and merge them into the main project. GitHub, as the code repository, allows developers to upload their work, which then becomes part of the shared project.

GitHub Actions in CI/CD

GitHub Actions plays a crucial role as a CI/CD tool (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery):

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that code from different developers is regularly tested and integrated with the main codebase. This process helps identify issues early.
Continuous Deployment (CD) enables automated deployment of code to production or testing environments, keeping the project up to date with minimal manual effort.
GitHub Actions provides the tools to set up workflows that automate these processes, making it easier to maintain and update large collaborative projects.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Collaborative Workflows in Git with GitHub Actions
Understanding Continuous Integration (CI) in Collaborative Development

Continuous Integration (CI) is essential in projects where multiple developers contribute code frequently. In CI, developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each time a developer commits new code, an automated build and testing process is triggered to verify that these changes don't disrupt existing functionality.

Example Setup in CI:

Developers and Stories: In a data science project, Developer A, Developer B, and Developer C each work on different stories (Story A, Story B, and Story C, respectively). These stories represent specific functionalities that need to be implemented.
Branch Creation: Following best practices, each developer creates a new branch (e.g., Story A Branch) derived from the main branch. This isolates their changes to avoid disturbing the main branch, which contains stable code.
Testing and Building: Before merging their branch into the main branch, developers write test cases to ensure that the new functionality works as expected and that it doesn’t interfere with the existing features.
GitHub Actions in CI/CD:

Automated Workflows: GitHub Actions allow developers to set up workflows that automatically build and test code on each push or pull request.
Conflict Resolution: When multiple developers modify the same file, merge conflicts can arise (e.g., if both Developer A and Developer B make changes to app.py). Git helps in resolving these conflicts by integrating compatible changes into the main branch.
Code Review and Best Practices: Part of the workflow in GitHub Actions can include automated code reviews, checking for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
Continuous Integration Workflow Steps:

Branching for New Stories: Developers create branches for each new feature (e.g., Story A Branch), perform the required coding, and commit their changes.
Testing with Workflows: CI workflows automatically run test cases to verify that the new functionality is stable.
Code Review and Build: GitHub Actions can include automated checks to ensure best practices are followed, and the project builds correctly.
Merging with Conflict Resolution: After passing all tests and code reviews, changes from each branch are merged into the main branch. If conflicts occur, developers resolve them before the final merge.
By following these workflows, continuous integration ensures the collaborative development process is smooth, automated, and reliable. This CI process, facilitated by GitHub Actions, supports seamless updates even in projects with multiple contributors.

Key Takeaways on Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Developer Workflows
Continuous Integration (CI)

CI involves automatically building and testing code whenever developers push changes to a shared repository.
CI helps maintain a stable codebase, ensuring new changes don’t disrupt existing functionality.
Workflows are essential here as they automate the build and test processes, reducing manual work and catching issues early.
Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD extends CI by automating the deployment of code to various environments, such as development (Dev), quality assurance (QA), user acceptance testing (UAT), and production.
A typical workflow could look like:
Dev Environment: The first testing ground where development teams ensure initial functionalities work.
QA Environment: QA teams perform further testing to identify any bugs.
UAT Environment: A pre-production environment where final testing occurs.
Production Environment: The live application is deployed once all testing phases are successful.
Deployment Automation via Docker

Docker containers are frequently used to deploy applications across different environments without compatibility issues.
Docker images ensure consistent behavior across environments, making it easier to deploy from Dev to QA to Production without reconfiguring setups.
Workflows

Workflows in CI/CD define a series of automated steps to control code integration, testing, and deployment.
In GitHub, workflows can be managed using GitHub Actions and YAML files, where specific conditions and server details automate deployment steps and environments.
Developer Workflow Key Stages

Coding: Writing code is the first step, followed by peer reviews and commit tracking.
Version Control and Code Review: Developers use Git for version control, allowing easy tracking and collaboration.
Testing: Ensuring code quality with automated tests.
Continuous Integration and Deployment: Automating the build, test, and deployment process.
This CI/CD pipeline helps development teams deliver code faster, maintain high-quality standards, and automate repetitive tasks. Workflows provide structure and continuity across the development lifecycle, promoting productivity and reducing errors.

Code Writing: The first step is writing code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as VS Code. Here, developers follow coding standards to ensure readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

Version Control: This phase is crucial for collaboration, using tools like Git for managing the codebase. Version control allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, create branches, and resolve conflicts.

Code Review: Before merging a new feature branch into the main branch, teams conduct code reviews. This can include peer reviews, architect reviews, and other types, which help enforce best practices, improve code quality, and provide constructive feedback.

Testing: Automated testing is used to verify code functionality before merging. This includes:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components.
Integration Testing: Ensuring that different parts of the codebase work together without issues.
End-to-End Testing: Verifying the entire workflow from start to finish.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI automates the building and testing of code whenever a new commit is made. This helps identify issues early, allowing developers to fix them before merging.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Following CI, CD deploys the application to various environments like QA, Dev, and Production. This ensures that each stage of development is tested and the final product is ready for end-users.

Real-World Example: The speaker provides an example of a feature development workflow, where a developer creates a branch, codes in their local environment, pushes the branch to the remote repository, and initiates a pull request (PR). Team members review the PR, and an automated CI pipeline runs tests to confirm code quality before merging into the main branch.

This workflow enables efficient development, quality control, and collaboration among multiple developers, ensuring a streamlined path from coding to deployment.

Summary of the CI/CD Workflow Explanation
CI/CD Pipeline Overview
Pipeline Initialization:

The CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline automatically triggers when a Pull Request (PR) is created. This process includes building the application and running all types of test cases (unit, integration, etc.).
Approval and Merging:

If the pipeline passes (all tests succeed), the PR is approved, and the code is merged into the main branch. This involves executing various checks before merging to ensure code quality and functionality.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

After merging, a CD pipeline is triggered. This can deploy the application to a development or staging environment for further testing before going to production.
Event-Driven Workflow:

The pipeline follows a specific workflow triggered by events (e.g., merging a PR). Each event triggers a series of automated steps, including building, testing, and deploying.
Benefits of CI/CD
Improved Collaboration: Establishes a clear workflow, enhancing teamwork.
High Code Quality: Automated code reviews and testing maintain high standards.
Reduced Errors: Minimizes human errors through automation.
Faster Delivery: Streamlined processes enable quicker development and release cycles.
Continuous Feedback: Regular monitoring allows rapid identification and resolution of issues.

Importing Functions in Test File:

Import functions using:
python
Copy code
from src.math_operations import addition, subtraction
Writing Unit Tests:

Use the assert statement to check function outputs:
python
Copy code
def test_addition():
    assert addition(2, 3) == 5
    assert addition(-1, 1) == 0

def test_subtraction():
    assert subtraction(5, 3) == 2
    assert subtraction(3, 3) == 0
    assert subtraction(2, 3) == -1
